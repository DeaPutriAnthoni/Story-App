# 🌍 Story App

**Story App** is a location-based storytelling platform where users can share their experiences, daily moments, or unique stories along with the place where they happened. Each story is manually tagged with a location, making it easier to discover context-rich content.

This project is part of a **Dicoding submission**, aiming to understand and apply modern web development technologies.
